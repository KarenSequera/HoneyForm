# HoneyForm - TFG Project

## Abstract

Critical infrastructure encompasses a group of sectors that are essential for modern society functioning. Were they to fail, the consequences for a nation and its inhabitants could be dire. Considering this, the project studies honeypot deployment in four of these infrastructures to mitigate and fight against digital threats. To employ honeypots, careful design and proper placement are needed. This is not an easy undertaking and requires specialized knowledge that may not be available to all organizations, especially to those smaller in size.

To address this gap, following an investigation into the topic, this bachelor’s thesis culminates in the development of a self-assessment web application that provides honeypot deployment recommendations based on the sector’s threat landscape and the user’s answers. These recommendations are intended to serve as an initial assessment, available to anyone, for a honeypot deployment project.
